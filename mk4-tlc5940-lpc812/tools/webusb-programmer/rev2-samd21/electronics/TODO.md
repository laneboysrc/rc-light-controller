# Issues found when building Rev 2

* Reverse-mount LED hole needs to be increased to 2.1mm
* Micro-USB hole size should be 1mm, way too large in Rev 2 (issue caused by wrong datahseet being used)


# TODO for Rev 2 of the WebUSB programmer hardware

DONE Change Micro-USB connector to one that has through-hole mounts
    DONE Ensure solder pads are longer!
    DONE Place the USB connector on the opposite side
DONE Change output resistors to resistor network
DONE Make all LED reverse mount so we can solder them in one go
    DONE Consider changing to 1204
DONE Replace 47uF Tantal with 0805 MLCC (1..10u?)
DONE Use flat pin header like on light controller
