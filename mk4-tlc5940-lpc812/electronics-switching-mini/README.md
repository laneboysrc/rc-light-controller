# Mk4S-mini - light controller with pin headers and 3 switching outputs

This is a new variant of the DIY RC Light Controller Mk4.
It has 3 (Mosfet) switched outputs on standard 2.54 mm pin headers.

This light controller is supposed to be used as "Slave" light controller in conjunction with an Mk4, Mk4P or Mk4S light controller. It is useful when more than one switched light output is required when using an Mk4 or Mk4P.

There are two circuit board designs available: one for the NXP LPC812 and one for LPC832 microcontroller, both in TSSOP-20 package.
