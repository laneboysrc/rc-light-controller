# Light programs

Light programs are simple scripts that allow end-users to build custom light sequences that go beyond the fixed car related functions built into the Mk4 Light Controller.

Light programs can be triggered when the light controller goes into certain states of operation. For example, a light program can be written to flash a 3rd brake light whenever the brakes are enganged.

Light programs are entered into the corresponding edit field in the light controller [Configurator](https://laneboysrc.github.io/rc-light-controller/).

A total number of 20 light programs can exist at a certain time.

Here is a simple light program example:

    // ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    // Light up the main beam lights while the light controller is
    // initializing.
    //
    // Normally the main beam would be on only if the parking lights are
    // already on, so just the main beam lighting up is a unique
    // identifiaction.
    // ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    run when initializing

    use all leds
    led main-beam-l = led[2]
    led main-beam-r = led[3]

    loop:
        fade all leds stepsize 0
        all leds = 0%
        main-beam-l, main-beam-r = 100%
        sleep 0
        goto loop

    end

Everything from ``//`` until the end of the line is considered as comment.

The ``run when`` line describes the condition that the light controller must be in for the program to run. In this case the light program runs when the light controller is starting up (i.e. waiting a short time until power up until it reads the center points for steering and throttle channels).

``use all leds`` declares that no other light controller function shall control any of the LEDs while this light program is running. The lines ``led ... = led[y]`` assign human readable names to light outputs 2 and 3.

This ends the declaration section.

The ``loop:`` statement defines a label that can be used to jump to from a ``goto`` instruction.

``fade all leds stepsize 0`` turns slowly fading LEDs in and out off for all LEDs, i.e. all LEDs turn on and off in an instant.

Then all LEDs are switched off, after which led[2] and led[3] are specifically set to fully on (100% brightness).

The light program pauses then for one 20 ms period (``sleep 0``), which causes the LED values we assigned to be actually executed and other light controller functions to run.
Without the sleep statement the light program would run for 50 internal instructions before being forcefully paused, which is unnecessary. After the 20 ms are over, the ``goto`` statement is executed and the light program continues from the begin.

The following sections explain all elements of the light program language in detail.


## Light program structure

Light programs are **line-based**, meaning a single statement or declaration must be on the same source code line.

All light programs comprise of the following structure

    run conditions

    constants, variable and led declarations

    statements (= the actual code)

    end

These elements are described below in further detail.

> **Important!**
>
> * Every light program **must** end with an ``end`` statement.
> * A new-line must be present after the ``end`` statement.


## Comments

Everything behind ``//`` or ``;`` until the end of the line is considered a *comment*.

Comments are useful for describing what the light program does. The comments are not stored into the light controller itself, but can be saved in the *Configurator* through saving the configuration.

Here is a valid light program showing various forms of comments:

    // This is a test to ensure the comment system works
    //

    // Another comment, with an empty line in front
    run always  // no-signal

        sleep 1     // Sleep for 1 ms. Actually will sleep for about 20ms...
    pos1:
        sleep 2     // Sleep for 2ms // Comment in comment
        goto forward_declaration
        ; Also semicolons can be used for comments
    pos2:               ; This is a comment at a label
        sleep 3
        goto pos1

    forward_declaration:
        sleep 4
    //pos2:
    ;  pos2:
        goto pos2

        end


## Line continuation

While light programs are line-based, if the last character on a line is ``\`` the statement is assumed to be continued on the following line. This can be useful to prevent excessively long lines in source code, making it more readable.

The following shows a valid light program, but it is certainly _not advisable_ to write like this:

    run \
       when\
        indicator-left or braking \
        or \        // Comment here, should not matter ...
        indicator-right blink-flag \

    // ^ That linefeed has terminated the run when statement

        sleep 0
    pos1 :
    pos2 \
    :                  // Not very readable, but correct...
        sleep \
            2
            goto \
                pos1
        goto \
    pos2

        end


## Identifiers

Light programs can assign human readable names to constants, variables, LEDs and labels. These are called identifiers.

Identifiers must start with a character ``a..z`` or ``A..Z`` and continue with a number of alphanumeric characters, ``-`` or ``_``. Identifiers are case sensitive.

**Examples of valid identifiers**

    testvariable
    var_with_underscore
    name-with-dash
    ThisOneHas1Number

**Examples of invalid identifiers**

    3test       // does not start with a..zA..Z
    name&value  // & not allowed in identifiers
    _min        // does not start with a..zA..Z


## Run conditions

*Run conditions* define the state the light controller must be in for a light program to be executed. Each light program defines its own run condition. More than one light program may run at the same time.

There are several types of *run conditions*:

* **Events**

    Events are single-shot actions that can trigger execution of a light program. At the moment the only event supported by the light controller is "gear changed". Events have the highest priority of all *run conditions*.

* **Priority run conditions**

    These run conditions take precendence over ordinary run coditions.

* **Run conditions**

    Ordinary conditions like forward, braking, indicators, etc.

A light program can define multiple run conditions of the same type. For example, a light program can be run when the light controller is either *forward*  or *braking*.

However, a light program can not mix events, priority run conditions and run conditions.

Run conditions must be the first no-comment or empty line in the light program.
The syntax is as follows:

    run always
    run when cond1
    run when cond1 cond2
    run when cond1 or cond2

``run always`` is a special condition that runs the light program at all times.

``run when cond1`` describes a single condition that must be met for the light program to run.

``run when cond1 cond2`` and ``run when cond1 or cond2`` are identical and define that the light program shall be executed when *cond1* **or** *cond2* are met.


### Priority run conditions and events

- **no-signal**

    The light program runs when the light controller does not receive a valid servo input signal on at least one of the input channels.

- **initializing**

    The light program runs after startup while the light controller waits before reading center points of steering and throttle channels.

- **servo-output-setup-centre, servo-output-setup-left, servo-output-setup-right**

    The light program runs when the respective setup function for the steering wheel servo or gearbox servo is triggered. Performing **eight CH3-clicks** starts servo setup. These run conditions can be used to drive the lights in a unique manner to guide the user through the servo setup.

- **reversing-setup-steering, reversing-setup-throttle**

    The light program runs when the servo reversing for the steering/throttle channel is engaged. Performing **seven CH3-clicks** starts steering and throttle reversing. These run conditions can be used to guide the user through the setup process.

- **gear-changed**

    This event fires whenever the gear is changed. It only applies when the light controller is configured to drive a 2-speed or 3-speed gearbox using a servo connected to the OUT/ISP ouptut. The run condition can be used to perform a short light animation, indicating to the user that the gear change occured.

- **shelf-queen-mode** (firmware version 20 and later)

    The light program runs when shelf queen mode has activated. Shelf queen
    mode is engaged when there is no receiver signal for more than 5 seconds. It simulates driving behaviour: turning lights on an off, braking, reversing, indicator and hazard usage.


### Run conditions

- **light-switch-position-0 .. light-switch-position-8**

    The light program runs when the virtual light switch, which is incremented by one CH3-click and decremented by two CH3-clicks, is in the given postion.

- **neutral, forward, reversing, braking**

    The light program runs when the throttle is in neutral, the car is driving forward, reversing, or is braking. Neutral, forward and reversing are mutually exclusive. Braking may be active when in parallel with the other states.
    The exact behaviour of these conditions depends on the ESC configuration of the light controller. For example, if the ESC type is configured as Forward/Brake only, then a light program with the condition``run when reversing`` will never execute.

- **indicator-left, indicator-right**

    The light program runs when the left/right indicator (turn signal) is active. The indicators are engaged by having throttle and steering in neutral for one second, and then moving the steering either left or right.

- **hazard**

    The light program runs when the hazard lights are active. The hazard lights can be toggled on/off with four CH3-clicks.

- **blink-flag**

    The light program runs during the bright period of the blink timer used for indicators and hazard lights. By default the blink frequency is 1.5 Hz (320 ms half-period during which the blink-flag is set).

- **blink-left, blink-right**

    The light program runs during the bright period of the respective left or right indicator light.

- **program-state-0 .. program-state-4**

    The light program runs when the value of the global variable with the same name is not 0 (zero).
    This allows light programs to trigger other light programs.
    For more information please refer to the section near the end of this document.


## Constants

Good programming practice suggests to never use immediate number values within code, but rather define the values as constants at the begin of the program. This can make maintenance easier, i.e. to change the same delay time used in several places within a light program.

A constant is declared by giving it an identifier and assigning a value:

    const LOOP_COUNT = 10
    const thisIsAConstant_too = 42
    const constant3 = 3

The constants can then be used in the light program:

    // Blink LED 5 three times
    var count
    led light = led[5]
    const LOOP_COUNT = 3
    const BLINK_DELAY = 250
    const BRIGHTNESS = 40

        count = 0

    loop:
        light = BRIGHTNESS
        sleep BLINK_DELAY

        light = 0
        sleep BLINK_DELAY

        count += 1
        skip if count >= LOOP_COUNT
        goto loop

        end


## Declarations

The declaration section defines the LEDs and variables used by the light program and assigns human readable names to them.

Variable and LED declarations can appear in any order in the declaration section.

### Variable declaration

Variables are storage locations that hold numeric values. In total all light programs together can utilize a total of 100 variables.

Variables have a data type of *signed 16-bit integer*. This means that the range of numbers that can be stored is *-32768* to *32767*.

All variables (local, global and pre-defined) are initialized to `0` when the light controller starts


A variable is created by declaring its identifier:

    var ThisIsAVariable
    var another-one

Variables can also be used to exchange information between different light programs. These are called *global variables*. All programs that want to access a global variable must use the same identifier when declaring the variable.

Light program 1:

    global var i_am_global
    var but_i_am_local
    global var VARIABLE3

Light program 2:

    global var i_am_global
    var VARIABLE3

Light program 3:

    global var VARIABLE3

Light programs 1 and 2 share the global variable ``i_am_global``.
Light program 1 and 3 declare another global variable ``VARIABLE3``. Light program 2 also declares ``VARIABLE3``, but as local variable, so in this example ``VARIABLE3`` of light program 2 is a separate, private storage location from the global ``VARIABLE3`` shared by light programs 1 and 3.

### Pre-defined variables

The light controller pre-defined a few global variables, accessible by all light programs:

- **aux, aux2, aux3, aux4, aux5, aux6**

    This variable reflects the state of the CH3 (AUX), AUX2 to AUX6 inputs respectively. The range is from -100 .. 0 .. +100. AUX4, AUX5 and AUX6 are only available when using i-Bus or S.Bus.


- **ch3-pin**

    This variable reflects the logic state of the CH3 input pin of the light controller. Its value reads 0 when
    the pin is *low* and 1 when the pin is *high*. This allows external electronics to control light programs. Note that this only works when the light controller is using a Pre-Processor, i-Bus or S.Bus. It can not be used when the light controller reads servo signals directly.


- **clicks**

    This variable is incremented every time six CH3-clicks are performed. Useful to control different sequences in a light program.

- **gear**

    If the configuration has the control of a gearbox servo enabled, this variable reflects the current gear. The light program can also change to a new gear. If an invalid
    gear number is assigned then the assignment is ignored and reverted back to the
    current gear once the light program execution yields.

- **hazard**

    *Writing* to this variable allows light programs to turn the hazard lights on or off.
    Write a value of *1* to switch the hazard lights on, or *0* to turn the hazard lights off.
    This variable should be used as **write-only variable**; when reading its value it is undeterministic. If you want to execute light programs instructions based on whether hazard lights are active or not, then use the *hazard* car state (see below).

- **light-switch-position**

    This variable reflects the current position of the virtual light switch. It can be modified by light programs to turn the light switch to a specific position as well.

- **program-state-0 .. program-state-4**

    These variables allow software-triggering of light programs. Each of them
    has an associated run condition, for example ``run when program-state-3``.
    The light program runs when the variable has a value other than 0.

- **servo**

    If Light Program Servo Control is enabled in the configuration, this variable
    can be used to read and set the current servo location in the range of -100
    (left endpoint) .. 0 (center) .. +100 (right endpoint). Values set outside
    this range are clamped to -100 or +100. Note that the endpoints and center
    position can be adjusted in the light controller by performing **eight CH3-clicks**.
    Refer to the light controller user manual for details.

- **shelf-queen-mode**

    *Writing* to this variable allows light programs to turn the shelf queen mode (a kind of show car mode where the light controller simulates lights as if the car would be driving) on or off.
    This variable should be used as **write-only variable**; when reading its value it is undeterministic. If you want to execute light programs instructions based on whether shelf queen mode is active or not, then use the *shelf-queen-mode* priority run condition (see above).

- **steering**

    This variable reflects the state of the steering input (ST/Rx). Its range is from -100 .. 0 .. +100.

- **throttle**

    This variable reflects the state of the throttle (accelerator, TH/Tx) input. Its range is from -100 .. 0 .. +100.

> **Important**:
>
> Do not write to *steering*, *throttle*, *aux*, *aux2* to *aux6*. Those variables should be considered read-only; write operations may have undeterministic effects on other light programs using these variables.
>
> *aux*, *aux2* and *aux3* are only usable in conjunction with the 5-channel Pre-Processor, i-Bus or S.Bus.
> *aux4*, *aux5* and *aux6* are only usable in conjunction with i-Bus or S.Bus.

### LED declarations

LED declarations serve two purpose:

- They define which LEDs are used by the light program, preventing lower priority light programs and car functions to overwrite the LED brightness while the light program is running.

- They give human readable names to LEDs, which also makes it easy to swap LED outputs at a later time.

LEDs are declared in light programs as follows:

    use all leds
    led license_plate_light = led[0]
    led dashboard-light = led[1]
    led slave_led_15 = led[31]

``use all leds`` gives the light program control of all LEDs. This is useful for light programs that intend to take over all LEDs during special run conditions such as ``initializing`` or ``no-signal``.

Assigning identifiers to individual LEDs follows the form ``led x = led[y]`` where ``x`` is the identifier and ``y`` is the number of the LED output of the light controller to use. For a single light controller the output number range is ``0..15``. The LEDs on a slave light controller range from ``16..31``.

LEDs can also be declared in the Configurator. In the ``LED configuration`` tab click on the spanner icon for a particular LED. This opens up new edit fields. Enter a name that is a [valid identifer](#identifiers). Now this name can be used in light programs (without additional declaration):

    // Blink LEDs named 'indicator-l' and 'indicator-r' in the LED configuration table
    loop:
        sleep 330
        led[indicator-l], led[indicator-r] = 100
        sleep 330
        led[indicator-l], led[indicator-r] = 0
        goto loop

### Taking control of LEDs

LEDs may be addressed by more than one light program, and may also be assigned any of the standard car light functions (brake light, indicator ...).

A priority scheme has been implemented to clearly define which function has control over an LED:

    Events                  (highest priority)

    Priority run condition

    Run condition

    Normal car functions    (lowest priority)

Light programs that have an event as run condition have the highest priority. Then follow light programs with priority run conditions. After that light programs with ordinary run conditions. If the LED is still available after this the normal car function assigned to it in the *Configurator* is performed.

Within the same priority group, the first active light program specified in the light program source code gets access to the LED.

When a light program is active but one or more LED have been used already by another light program of higher priority, the light program will still continue to run but any setting of LED values and fade times will not be carried out.

It is therefore important for light programs to be implemented with awareness that higher priority light programs may re-assign LED brightness and fade values (see later sections). As such every light program should always set fade and light values in a loop and not rely that it has set a certain value earlier, as the values may have been overwritten by another light program executing at higher priority.


## Statements

The actual light program function is described in a sequence of statements, which are described in this section.

### Statement arguments

Most statements support a variety of different arguments:

    var x
    led LED1a = led[8]

    x = 42          // Immedite decimal number
    x = -1          // Immedite negative decimal number
    sleep 0x14      // Immediate hexadecimal number
    sleep x         // Use value of a variable as sleep time in milliseconds
    x = LED1a       // Current value of led[8], range 0..100
    x = random      // A pseudo-random value between -32768 and 32767
    x = clicks      // Pre-defined global variable "clicks"
    x = light-switch-position  // Pre-defined global variable
    x = steering    // Steering channel (range: -100..100), read-only
    x = throttle    // Throttle channel (range: -100..100), read-only
    x = aux         // AUX/CH3 channel (range: -100..100), read-only
    x = aux2        // AUX2 channel (range: -100..100), read-only
    x = aux3        // AUX3 channel (range: -100..100), read-only
    x = gear        // Current gear,
                    //   only useful if gearbox servo support is enabled
    x = servo       // Current servo position -100..0..+100,
                    //   only useful if light program servo control is enabled

Note: aux, aux2 and aux3 are only available when a 5-channel Pre-Processor, i-Bus or S.Bus is used.


### Assignments

Variables can be assigned a value:

    var x
    var y
    led LED1a = led[8]

    x = 42          // Assign decimal number 42
    x = -1          // Assign decimal number -1 (variables are signed 16-bit)
    x = 0xbeef      // Assign hexadecimal number BEEF
    x = y           // Copy value of variable "y"
    x = LED1a       // Copy value of led[8] (range: 0..100)
    x = random      // Retrieve a random value
    x = clicks      // Copy value of global variable "clicks"
    x = steering    // Copy value of steering channel (range: -100..100)
    x = throttle    // Copy value of throttle channel (range: -100..100)

Assignments to variables can also perform mathematical functions:

    x += 42         // x = x + 42
    x -= 0xcafe     // x = x - 0xcafe
    x *= 0xbabe
    x /= LED1a
    x &= y          // bit-wise AND
    x |= 0x80       // bit-wise OR
    x ^= 15         // bit-wise XOR
    x %= 8          // Modulo operation

> **Division by zero**
>
> If a ``x /= y`` assignment is made where the divisor is 0 then the result
> is set to 32767 (largest possible integer value).


The assigment operations for LEDs is limited: only immediate values or values stored in variables can be assigned. No mathematical operations can be performed. However, multiple LEDs can be assigned in a single statement.

    var x
    led LED1a = led[8]
    led LED1b = led[9]
    led LED1c = led[10]
    led LED1d = led[11]
    led LED2 = led[4]

    LED1a = 100     // Turn the LED fully on
    LED1a = 100%    // Exactly the same as above,
                    //   the % sign can be added for clarity

    LED1a, LED1b, LED1c, LED1d = 25  // Set multiple LEDs at once

    // Set multiple LEDs at once, however because the LED numbers are
    // no longer consecutive this translates into two light program
    // instructions.
    LED1a, LED1b, LED2 = 50%

    // Set LED to the value stored in variable x. If the value of x is
    // negative or zero the LED is turned off. If the value of x is
    // greater or equal to 100 the LED is turned fully on.
    LED1d = x
    LED1c, LED1d = x

The brightness values are specified using values between 0 (LED is off) and 100 (LED is driven at the maximum current of 20 mA). For intermediate values, gamma correction is applied to adjust for the non-linearity of the human eye. The correction is done in a way that 50% is roughly half the perceived brightness of 100%.
The gamma correction factor can be adjusted in the advanced configuration of the light controller.

Beside specifying LEDs individually, the shortcut ``all leds`` allows assigning values to all *declared* LEDs.

    led LED1a = led[8]
    led LED1b = led[9]
    led LED1c = led[10]
    led LED1d = led[11]
    led LED2 = led[4]

    all leds = 0    // Turns LED1a, LED1b, LED1c, LED1d and LED2 off

If ``use all led`` is declared, then the ``all leds`` shortcut affects all LEDs of the light controller, not just the ones declared individually.

    use all leds
    led LED1a = led[8]
    led LED1b = led[9]

    all leds = 0    // Turns led[0..15] off
    LED1a = 100     // Turns led[8] fully on
    LED1b = 50      // Turns led[9] to half brightness.


### Labels

Labels are identifiers that mark locations in the light program that can be jumped to with the ``goto`` statement.

Labels must appear on their own line. They do not perform any activity, nor do they consume memory. Labels comprise of an identifier followed by a ``:`` (colon).

Example:

    run always

        sleep 1
    pos1:
        sleep 2
        goto forward_declaration

    pos2:
        sleep 3
        goto pos1

    forward_declaration:
        sleep 4
        goto pos2

        end


### Goto

The ``goto`` statement redirects program execution to a different part of the light program. The parameter of the ``goto`` statement must be a label identifier that resides in the same light program.

> **Important**
>
> It is not possible to branch to a label in another light program.


### Sleep

The ``sleep`` statment suspends the execution of the light program for the given number of milliseconds. The resolution of timing is 20 milliseconds, which means that ``sleep 1`` causes a suspension for 20 ms rather than 1 ms.

It is only when a light program is suspended that the LED values assigned by the program are becoming into effect. It is therefore good practice to add ``sleep`` statements in loops of light programs.

Since the light contoller firmware is implemented using a *mainloop* and co-operative multi-tasking, light programs are forcefully suspended for one mainloop every 50 statements if no ``sleep`` statement is encountered during execution of the light program.


### Fade

Instead of turning LEDs on in an instant, the light controller supports gradually increasing and decreasing of brightness. This feature was originally designed to simulate incandescent bulbs, but may be useful for other effects.

Light programs are able to control fading of LEDs using the ``fade`` command.

The ``fade`` command has a ``stepsize`` parameter, which determines the maximum brightness change an LED performs within 20 milliseconds.

    var x
    led LED1a = led[8]
    led LED1b = led[9]
    led LED1c = led[10]
    led LED1d = led[11]
    led LED2 = led[4]

    all leds = 0%
    fade LED2 stepsize 0
    fade LED1a, LED1b, LED1c, LED1d stepsize 20
    all leds = 100%

This light program turns LEDs LED1a, LED1b, LED1c, LED1d and LED2 off, then sets that LED2 changes brightness immediately (``stepsize 0``), LED1a..d change at most 20% per 20 milliseconds, and finally turns all declared LEDs to full brightness.
This will turn on LED2 to full brightness immediately (no fading) and LED1a..d will fade to full brightness within 100 ms (``stepsize 20`` means there are 5 steps needed to go from 0 to 100, each step taking 20 ms).


### Conditional statements

Light programs can make use of ``skip if`` statements to change program flow depending on various conditions.

    var x
    global var y
    led l = led[7]
    led l2 = led[8]

    somewhere:
        skip if x == 1      // Skip the next statement, which happens to be
                            // "goto" but could be any statement, if value of
                            // variable x is equal to 1
        goto somewhere

        // Further statements after skip if removed for brevity

        skip if x != 2      // skip if x not equal 2
        skip if x > 3       // skip if x greater than 3
        skip if y < 4       // skip if y less than 4
        skip if x >= 5      // skip if x greater or equal to 5
        skip if x <= 6      // skip if x less than or equal to 6

        skip if x == y      // skip if value of x is same as value of y

        skip if x != l      // skip if value of variable x is not the same
                            // as the value of led[7]

        skip if l >= 5      // skip if led[7] is greater or equal to 5 (5%)
        skip if l > x       // skip if led[7] is greater than value of x
        skip if l2 < l      // skip if value of led[8] is less than value
                            // of led[7]

Any valid light program statement can follow a ``skip if`` instruction.

    led l = led[7]

        // Turn the LED off if pre-defined variable clicks is below 3, otherwise on
        l = 0
        skip if clicks < 3
        l = 100

However, care has to be taken with assignments to multiple LEDs:

    led l1 = led[7]
    led l2 = led[8]
    led l3 = led[9]

        // Turn the LED off if pre-defined variable clicks is below 3, otherwise on
        l1, l2, l3 = 0
        skip if clicks < 3
        l1, l2, l3 = 100

This will work fine as the LED assignment works on consecutive LEDs, which can be encoded in a single machine operation. However, if another user would modify this light program to use different, non-consecutive LEDs, thing go wrong:

    led l1 = led[0]
    led l2 = led[8]
    led l3 = led[9]

        // Turn the LED off if pre-defined variable clicks is below 3, otherwise on
        l1, l2, l3 = 0
        skip if clicks < 3
        l1, l2, l3 = 100        // This is no longer a single operation!

The light program assembler translates this into the following statements:

    led l1 = led[0]
    led l2 = led[8]
    led l3 = led[9]

        // Turn the LED off if pre-defined variable clicks is below 3, otherwise on
        l1 = 0
        l2, l3 = 0
        skip if clicks < 3
        l1 = 100
        l2, l3 = 100

The behaviour would be incorrect as l2 and l3 will be always on and only l1 will be on when *clicks* is greater or equal to 3.
The light program assembler will therefore generate an error message if multiple LEDs are assigned after a ``skip if`` statement.

Note that this also applies to the ``all leds`` shortcut.

#### Testing variables and LEDs

The test condition of a ``skip if`` statement can use immediate values, variables, constants, or LEDs.

All of the following are valid ``skip if`` statements:

    var x
    global var y
    led light = led[7]
    led light2 = led[2]

        skip if x == 1
        skip if y < 4
        skip if clicks < 4      // Pre-defined variable *clicks*
        skip if x != y
        skip if x == light
        skip if light > 50
        skip if light2 < light
        skip if steering > -30  // Test Steering channel
        skip if aux2 < 80       // Test AUX2 channel

Note that the left operand of the comparison is restricted to variables (both local and global) and LEDs.
This means that the following are **not valid statements**:

    var x
    global var y
    led light = led[7]
    led light2 = led[2]

        skip if 1 == x          // Left operand is *immediate*



#### Testing *car state*

The second form of the ``skip if`` statement allows to change program behaviour based on the *car state*.

    skip if is hazard       // skip if single car state condition is true
    sleep 1

    skip if not hazard      // skip if single car state condition is false
    sleep 1

    // skip if any of the specified car states is true
    skip if any hazard indicator-left indicator-right
    sleep 1

    // skip if all specified car states are true
    skip if all hazard indicator-left indicator-right
    sleep 1

    // skip if none of the specified car states are true (i.e. all are false)
    skip if none hazard indicator-left indicator-right
    sleep 1

The following car states can be tested using ``skip if`` statements:


- **light-switch-position-0 .. light-switch-position-8**

    The virtual light switch position, which is incremented by one CH3-click and decremented by two CH3-clicks.

- **neutral, forward, reversing, braking**

    The throttle is in neutral, the car is driving forward, reversing, or is braking.

- **indicator-left, indicator-right**

    The left/right indicator (turn signal) is engaged.

- **hazard**

    The hazard lights are engaged.

- **blink-flag**

    The bright period of the blink timer used for indicators and hazard lights is active.

- **blink-left, blink-right**

    The left/right indicator or hazard light is engaged and the blink timer is in the bright period.

- **servo-output-setup-centre, servo-output-setup-left, servo-output-setup-right**

    The setup function for the steering wheel servo or gearbox servo is triggered.

- **reversing-setup-steering, reversing-setup-throttle**

    The servo reversing for the steering/throttle channel is engaged.

#### The *if* statement

For convenience the software that processes Light Programs also supports ``if`` statements.

An ``if`` statement is the logical opposite of a ``skip if`` statement.
For example:

    led l = led[7]

        // Turn the LED on if pre-defined variable clicks is 3 or more, otherwise off
        l = 0
        if clicks >= 3
        l = 100

has exactly the same behaviour as:

    led l = led[7]

        // Turn the LED off if pre-defined variable clicks is below 3, otherwise on
        l = 0
        skip if clicks < 3
        l = 100

However, the ``if`` statement may be easier to understand as ``skip if`` employs a negative logic: the next instruction is *not* executed if the condition is true.

Implementation-wise, the light controller can only process ``skip if`` statements. Therefore, when light programs are processed during exporting of a new configuration, all ``if`` statements are converted into the corresponding ``skip if`` statement.

The following table shows the conversion:


if | skip if
------------ | -------------
if x == 1 | skip if x != 1
if x != 2 | skip if x == 2
if x > 3 | skip if x <= 3
if x < 4 | skip if x >= 4
if x >= 5 | skip if x < 5
if x <= 6 | skip if x > 6
if is hazard  | skip if not hazard
if not hazard  | skip if is hazard
if any indicator-left indicator-right | skip if none indicator-left indicator-right
if none indicator-left indicator-right | skip if any indicator-left indicator-right
(no equivalent ``if`` statement!) | skip if all indicator-left indicator-right


## The ``end`` statement

Every light program **must** end with an ``end`` statement. A new-line must be added after the ``end`` statement, otherwise an error will be reported when the light program is processed by the *Configurator*.


## Having a light program trigger another light program

Sometimes we want to control LEDs only when a certain condition is met, even though no corresponding run condition is available.

For example, we may want to flash headlamps when we push a button on the transmitter. The button may trigger AUX2 on the light controller.

Unfortunately there is no run condition that triggers off AUX2.

We could make a light program with the run condition ``run always``, but that would mean that we also have to include logic to turn on the headlamps at the correct light switch position, as the LEDs are not assigned to the light program and no longer perform the original car function.

There is a better way though:

We create a short light program with the condition ``run always``. In this light program we check whether AUX2 has a value greater than 50. If yes, then we set the pre-defined global variable ``program-state-0`` to ``1``; if no, we set it to ``0``.

We can now create a second light program with the run condition ``run when program-state-0``. In this light program we take over the headlamps, and turn them on. Now only when AUX2 is pressed, the headlamps are controlled by the light program, but if AUX2 is released then the normal light functions assigned in the configurator are active.

    // ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    // Headlight-flasher using a momentary button on AUX2
    // ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    run always

    loop:
        // Set program-state-0 to 1 if AUX2 is greater than 50, otherwise set
        // it to 0
        program-state-0 = 0
        if aux2 > 50
        program-state-0 = 1

        // Process other light controller functions and start over
        sleep 40
        goto loop

    end

    // ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    run when program-state-0

    led headlamp-l = led[4]
    led headlamp-r = led[5]

        headlamp-l, headlamp-r = 100

    end


# Example light programs

The following page contains a number of light programs that you can incorporate in your own configuration or study to learn the light program language:

https://github.com/laneboysrc/rc-light-controller/tree/master/mk4-tlc5940-lpc812/configurations

The files ending with `.light_program` contain only light program scripts. They are simple text files that can be opened with any text editor.

Files ending in `.txt` are configuration files that you can load into the [Configurator](https://laneboysrc.github.io/rc-light-controller/). Not all configurations may contain light programs, but some do.
